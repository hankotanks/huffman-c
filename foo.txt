The geek code consists of several categories.  Each category is labeled with
a letter and some qualifiers.  Go through each category and determine which
set of qualifiers best describes you in that category.  By stringing all of
these 'codes' together, you are able to construct your overall geek code. 
It is this single line of code that will inform other geeks the world over
of what a great geek you actually are.

Some of the qualifiers will very probably not match with you exactly. 
Simply choose that qualifier that MOST CLOSELY matches you.  Also, some
activities described in a specific qualifier you may not engage in, while you
do engage in others.  Each description of each qualifier describes the wide
range of activities that apply, so as long as you match with one, you can
probably use that qualifier.
